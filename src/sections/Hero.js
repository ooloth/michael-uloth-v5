      As an opera singer, I've been lucky enough to perform with many wonderful opera
      companies and orchestras across Canada, the United States and Europe, including
      the Canadian Opera Company, Seattle Opera, the Glimmerglass Festival and OpÃ©ra
      de Lyon. You can see a selection of my past projects below and hear examples of
      my singing on SoundCloud and YouTube.

      Since building my own first "I'm an opera singer" website, I've built dozens of
      sites for singers, freelancers and small businesses looking to expand their
      online profile. I love creating modern-looking layouts that load quickly and
      look great on any device. In addition to my own projects, I am also the lead
      front-end developer for Coffeeshop Creative, a web design agency based in
      Toronto.
