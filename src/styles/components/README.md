# Component classes

_Add custom component classes to this folder (they will be imported by styles.css)_

## Tips

1. Add component classes to separate files (by component).

2. Use `@apply` to compose components out of existing utility classes.

3. Use `@screen` to create media queries that reference my custom breakpoints

4. Don't hard-code outer margins or positioning into reusable components
