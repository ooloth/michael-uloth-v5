# Utility classes

_Add custom utilities to this folder (they will be imported by styles.css)_

## Tips

1. Add utility classes to separate files (by category)

2. Generate responsive, hover, focus and group-hover versions using `@variants`

3. Use `@screen` to create media queries that reference my custom breakpoints
